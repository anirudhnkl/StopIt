		In todayâ€™s society, bullying is the most common form of violence. In fact, students who are victims of bullying are anywhere between two to nine times more likely to commit suicide than those who are not exposed to bullying. And to top that off, 75% of all school-shooting incidents have been directly linked to bullying. Made by Abhinav Pottabathula, Anirudh Balasubramaniam, Anish Krishnan, Varun Iyer.
